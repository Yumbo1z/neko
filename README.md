Free to use—I don’t care! If you want to add more to the original bot, DM me @Yumb01z. To get my attention faster, join my Discord server: https://discord.gg/zABQqMNvNa.

I’ll help you set up the bot if there are any issues, but I won’t assist with adding new commands or other modifications—I won’t spoon-feed you. If you need help with specific commands, join this server instead: https://discord.gg/djs.

You must have a MongoDB cluster and a token ready. I use Railway, a paid service, to host the bot.

If you're using VS Code, simply put your information in config.json, then go to all the proccess.env locations mentioned in the video and enable the line of code below the original.
